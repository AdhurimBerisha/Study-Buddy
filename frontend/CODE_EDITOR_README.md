## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- `react-icons`: Icon library for UI elements
- `tailwindcss`: Styling framework

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- JavaScript execution requires browser compatibility
- Monaco Editor works in all modern browsers

### Security Notes

- JavaScript execution uses `Function` constructor (client-side only)
- Other languages show syntax highlighting but don't execute
- For production, consider backend code execution services

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Backend Integration**: Support for Python, Java, C++ execution
- **Code Saving**: Save snippets to user profiles
- **Code Sharing**: Share code with other users
- **Collaborative Coding**: Real-time pair programming
- **Code History**: Track coding sessions and progress

### Backend Requirements

- Code execution service (e.g., Docker containers)
- Language-specific compilers and interpreters
- Security sandboxing for safe code execution
- Rate limiting and resource management
